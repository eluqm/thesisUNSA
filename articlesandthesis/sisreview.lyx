\begin_layout Title
Time Series for the Real Time Hydrological Forecasting: A systematic literature
 review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The wide use of hydrological time series data has initiated a great deal
 of research and development attempts in the field of data mining.
 Trend, pattern, simulation, similarity measures indexing, segmentation,
 visualization and forecasting carried out by the researchers with the implicit
 mining from the historical observed data.
 The systematic literature review of the existing hydrological parameter
 forecast research are explored to identify the present circumstances in
 hydrological forecasting techniques and its concerned issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing
 a manual search of journals and conference proceedings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Result: Of 14 relevant studies meeting the exclusion and inclusion criteria
 set out in the review protocol.
 The selected elements have been classified according to the approach/techniques
 they describe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Conclusions: Asian researchers, particularly India laboratories appear to
 be the leading exponents of hidrological topics.
 We observed that there are very few mathematical/ computational models
 available to predict 
\emph on
real time
\emph default
 hydrological forecast objectives.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forecasts are essential to allow sufficient time for various departments
 to develop plans for future development.
 Forecasting problems use either time series data that is a collection of
 data recorded over a period of time(weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly).
 There are several application domains of data mining with time series data,
 being that one important application domain weather forecast.
 Intelligent forecasting models have achieved better results than traditional
 statistical methods.
 Although the literature describes these methods are better, we can still
 improve the results in terms of accuracy in addition to other factors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent publications which have highlighted hydrological parameter prediction
 have been examined in this paper.
 For this purpose, we reviewed the current status of the use of techniques
 for time series weather forecast, along with the latest trends in the use
 of data mining for time series forecasting since 2005 using a secondary
 study.
 We describe our methodology in Section 2 and present our results in Section
 3.
 In Section 4 we answer our 4 major research questions.
 We present our conclusions in Section 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study has been undertaken as a systematic literature review(SLR) based
 on the original guidelines as proposed by Kitchenham 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kitchenham2004procedure"

\end_inset

.
 In this case the goal of the review is to assess the techniques for hidrologica
l time series forecasting, so this study is categorised as a secondary literatur
e review.
 The steps in the systematic literature review method are documented below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Research questions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research questions addressed by this study are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RQ1.
 How much hydrological parameters forecasting activity has there been since
 2005? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RQ2.
 What models are being addressed? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RQ3.
 Who is leading hydrological forecasting research? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RQ4.
 What are the limitations of current research?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to address RQ1, we identified the number of papers published per
 year, the journal/conferences that published them.
 With respect to RQ2, we considered the scope of the study (i.e.
 whether it looked at research trends, or whether it addressed a technology-cent
red research question) and the computer science topic area.
 With respect to RQ3, we considered individual researchers, the organisation
 to which researchers were affiliated and the country in which the organisation
 is situated.
 With respect to limitations of models (RQ4) we considered the quality of
 studies/models appropriate, if not, is it improving?.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Search process 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The search process was a manual search of specific conference proceedings,
 journal papers and digital libraries since 2005.
 The digital libraries and journals selected are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Selected-journals-and"

\end_inset

.
 The journals were selected because they were known to include either empirical
 studies or literature surveys, and to have been used as sources for other
 systematic literature reviews related to hidrological time series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each journal and conference proceedings was reviewed and the papers that
 addressed literature surveys of any type were identified as potentially
 relevant.
 We searched the specific journal or conference applied the detailed inclusion
 and exclusion criteria to the relevant papers (see the following Section).

\begin_layout Standard
We discuss the answers to our research questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How much hydrological parameters forecasting activity has there been since
 2005? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, we identified 14 relevant studies in the sources that we searched,
 considering the date of their publication as import factor, as shown in
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Selected-journals-and-1"

\end_inset

.
 One study was classified as SLR and 13 studies were classified as journal,
 proceding and conference document.
 All studies addressed different research approaches such as, Clustering
 ,Neural networks, SVM, Regression, Fuzzy logic.
 Thus, we selected 2 or more studies for each of these approaches and recent
 year of publication.
 Initially, we were surprised that have been used the automated search of
 ACM Computer Surveys using the ACM digital library, found low rate of SLRs
 on the topic of forecasting hidrological data.
 However, the lack of SLRs may be because, journals have significant publication
 lag.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What models are being addressed? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of hydrology area, 7 articles are related to forecasting Rainfall
 and Runoff problems.
 With respect to the techniques applied, three were related to Neural Networks
 research.
 2 related to Support Vector Machine estimation, in addition, the two studies
 that included regression methods.
 2 articles related to clustering experiments.
 1 articles related to fuzzy logic.
 Finally, we found articles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 that describing hybrid approaches with trend to use Neural Networks approach
 in conjunction with some of the approaches aforementioned(SVM, Clustering,
 AG, Fuzzy Logic).
 We may assert that neural networks and its derivatives currently they are
 being addressed by most of researchers in forecasting hydrological time
 series.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Who is leading hydrological forecasting research?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the set of studies are dominated by Asian researchers who have
 been involved in 11 of the studies.
 The research who contributed to more than two studies, Mishra, Satanand,
 is affiliated to CSIR-Advanced Material Process Research Institute in India.
 Only few studies had North American and European authors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What are the limitations of current research?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mapping studies(high quality) has the potential to radically change
 the nature of forecasting hidrological data.
 Mapping studies can highlight areas where there is a large amount of research
 that would benefit from more detailed SLRs and areas where there is little
 research that require more theoretical and empirical research.
 Thus, instead of every researcher undertaking their own research from scratch,
 a broad mapping study provides a common starting point for many researchers
 and many research initiatives.
 Relatively few SLRs have assessed the quality of the primary studies included
 in the review.
 This is acceptable in the context of studies of research trends but is
 more problematic for reviews that attempt to evaluate technologies.
 This is an issue where there needs to be improvement, since forecasting
 hydrological data is meant to impact practice not just academia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This review suggests that the Asian research laboratories, currently to
 leading in terms of forecast hidrological data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SLRs studies provides the references needed to initiate research programmes
 based of categorised research papers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results in this study suggest that the current output of the articles
 selected is strongly supported by Asian researchers.
 However, if hydrological forecast is to have a serious impact on engineering,
 statistic and computer science research and practice, it is important that
 researchers in other areas of the world take an increased interest in a
 formal models to forecasting, particularly, South America, because of its
 emerging in computer science research.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study suffers from a number of limitations; in particular, we have
 restricted ourselves to a manual search of international journals and conferenc
es.
 We plan to extend this study by undertaking a broader automated search
 for other SLRs over the same time period.
 This has the joint aim of extending the generality of this study and investigat
ing a number of issues associated with hydrological forecast topics.

Based on the literature review, it is find out that data based in artificial
 intelligence models like ANN; SVM are an alternative method particularly
 useful for runoff forecasting.
 There are several potential directions for future research such as the
 emerge deep learning concept.
